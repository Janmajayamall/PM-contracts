## What's Prediction Market for Content Curation?

It's simple. Using this app you can bet on twitter (or anywhere on the internet) whether an account is spam/fake or not, whether a post contains fake news or not, or whether a particular video is deep faked or not.

I will releasing the app soon on testnet. Please stay tuned :). 

Btw this work inspired from [Vitalik Buterin's post back in 2018](https://ethresear.ch/t/prediction-markets-for-content-curation-daos/1312)
